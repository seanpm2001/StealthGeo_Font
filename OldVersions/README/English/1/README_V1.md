# StealthGeo (Typeface)

## About

The StealthGeo font is a geometric font inspired by early digital clocks. It makes use of lines instead of circles or curves.

It is a curve-free geometric font for recreational use, and is currently a work in progress.

It is planned to support as many Latin and Cyrillic/Other characters as it can. I don't know how far the font can go, but I will push it to its limits.

StealthGeo will be an ODF/TTF/SVG/WOFF/Other font.
