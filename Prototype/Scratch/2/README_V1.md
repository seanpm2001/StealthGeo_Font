# Scratch 2 edition

This is the Scratch 2 edition of the StealhGeo Font. It is early in development, and is the first digital variant of the font. It is still needing a lot of polish and work, but it gives an idea of what the font will look like.

## Technical notes

This set of versions was created on Scratch 2 with a Raspberry Pi, which is based on Electron. It may not work with the main version of Scratch 2 (it might show up as an empty/new project) if it works for you under Windows, MacOS, or Ubuntu, please [start a discussion with a screenshot and what version of Scratch you are using to help me confirm its functionality](https://github.com/seanpm2001/StealhGeo_Font/discussions/).
